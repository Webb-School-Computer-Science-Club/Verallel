# Verallel
A student-made, student-tailored web extension for Veracross. Provides ease of navigation in Veracross, with other quality of life features, and even more in progress.

<br>
Unfortunatley, at the moment, this extension is compatible only for Webb students, as the links will not work if your Veracross is a different school.

# Chrome Installation

For the Firefox extension go to [https://github.com/Webb-School-Computer-Science-Club/Verallel/tree/firefox](https://github.com/Webb-School-Computer-Science-Club/Verallel/tree/firefox).

First, we need to download the [latest version](https://github.com/Webb-School-Computer-Science-Club/Verallel/releases/) of the extension. Scroll down the page of the latest versions list until you see a file link that says "VerallelCV(some version here).zip" (the C part is important, as it means chromium). Download the file to your Downloads folder and extract it.

Now, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in chrome. Toggle "developer mode" which is located in the top right corner of the screen. A bar should pop up with three options. Click "load unpacked" and navigate to the extracted extension folder. Click the folder, then click select.

Congrats! Verallel is now installed. Pin the extension via the chrome extensions menu in the top bar to make acessing Verallel more convenient.

# Issue Handling
When it comes to repository issues, please keep in mind that the developer team for Verallel has an order of priorities for issue fixing. There isn't a rigid order, but expect issues about major bugs to be solved first over adding minor feature enhancements. This shouldn't deter you from making an issue for a bug or a feature request if you have one, but acknowledge that there a limited amount of people on the team, each with other commitments of their own. <br> If you make an issue about a bug, please detail how you got to the bug and if that bug is consistently reproducible. Additionally, make sure your issue is not already an issue on the repository. 

# Helping with Development
If you wish to help with the development of the site, the zip folder release of the extension will be provided (and maybe some other beta versions the dev team is working on). If you are not part of the dev team and end up making yor own working version please publish the code as a fork of this repository. Additionally, make sure to detail the changes you make in your fork compared to the original.<br>
If you want to download the newest version of the repository to test things, you can always git clone it and then test it out on Chrome by turning on Developer mode in chrome://extensions and then loading the unzipped folder into your browser. You can test it out on Firefox by unzipping the folder and temporarily loading on the extension through the manifest.
