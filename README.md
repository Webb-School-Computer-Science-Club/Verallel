Version 1.1.0 has just released on Github and is about to be released on the webstore (the first 1.1.0 released will have a small bug, so probably wait until the patched version comes along in some days after that). Any commits after this release will be for some subsequent update, the scale of which is unknown at the moment.<br>

# Verallel
A student-made, student-tailored Chrome web extension for Veracross. Provides ease of navigation in Veracross, with other quality of life features, and even more in progress.<br>
 1.1.0 is a massive upgrade from 1.0.0, including a light/dark mode toggle, link to the drop box from the top, making sure no links open in new tabs, and fetching assignments and lesson plans from the popup. There definitley is more to do for further developing Verallel though!
<br>
Unfortunatley, at the moment, this extension is compatible only for Webb students, as the links will not work if your Veracross is a different school.

# Upcoming Updates
Version 1.1.0 recently released, but there are some features to note about the upcoming update:
  - Adding a dropdown for the directories to make it easier to get to the one the user wants
# Issue Handling
When it comes to repository issues, please keep in mind that the developer team for Verallel has an order of priorities for issue fixing. There isn't a rigid order, but expect issues about major bugs to be solved first over adding minor feature enhancements. This shouldn't deter you from making an issue for a bug or a feature request if you have one, but acknowledge that there a limited amount of people on the team, each with other commitments of their own. <br> If you make an issue about a bug, please detail how you got to the bug and if that bug is consistently reproducible. Additionally, make sure your issue is not already an issue on the repository. 

# Helping with Development
If you wish to help with the development of the site, the zip folder release of the extension will be provided (and maybe some other beta versions the dev team is working on). If you are not part of the dev team and end up making yor own working version please publish the code as a fork of this repository. Additionally, make sure to detail the changes you make in your fork compared to the original.<br>
