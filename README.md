Version 1.1.0 has just released on Github and is about to be released on the webstore (the first 1.1.0 released has a small bug, but another version will be released in some time that improves upon 1.1.0). Any commits after the 1.1.0 release will be for the subsequent update, the scale of which is unknown at the moment, but its release is coming some time in the near future.<br>

# Verallel
A student-made, student-tailored Chrome web extension for Veracross. Provides ease of navigation in Veracross, with other quality of life features, and even more in progress.<br>
 1.1.0 is a massive upgrade from 1.0.0, including a light/dark mode toggle, link to the drop box from the top, making sure no links open in new tabs, and fetching assignments and lesson plans from the popup. There definitley is more to do for further developing Verallel though!
<br>
Unfortunatley, at the moment, this extension is compatible only for Webb students, as the links will not work if your Veracross is a different school.

# Upcoming Updates
Upcoming updates for the next version of Verallel:
  - Adding a dropdown for the directories and classes to make it easier to get to the one the user wants
  - Making the calendar and other pages slightly easier to read by replacing class IDs with the name of the class or just eliminating class IDs all together
  - Scrolling down to the assignment due the soonest (relative to the current day, assumes no assignment is missing) from Dropbox page
  - Improving the style of the main portals Veracross page, including a better dark mode
# Issue Handling
When it comes to repository issues, please keep in mind that the developer team for Verallel has an order of priorities for issue fixing. There isn't a rigid order, but expect issues about major bugs to be solved first over adding minor feature enhancements. This shouldn't deter you from making an issue for a bug or a feature request if you have one, but acknowledge that there a limited amount of people on the team, each with other commitments of their own. <br> If you make an issue about a bug, please detail how you got to the bug and if that bug is consistently reproducible. Additionally, make sure your issue is not already an issue on the repository. 

# Helping with Development
If you wish to help with the development of the site, the zip folder release of the extension will be provided (and maybe some other beta versions the dev team is working on). If you are not part of the dev team and end up making yor own working version please publish the code as a fork of this repository. Additionally, make sure to detail the changes you make in your fork compared to the original.<br>
This is the repository for the Chrome extension for Verallel. If you want to help with Verallel as a Firefox add-on, you should check out <a href="https://github.com/Webb-School-Computer-Science-Club/Verallel-Firefox">Verallel-Firefox</a>
